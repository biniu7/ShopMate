You will be improving a CLAUDE.md file by applying best practices for creating regular expressions and prompt engineering. You have been provided with three key documents to work with.

Here is the PRD (Product Requirements Document) content:
<prd_content>
@.ai\doc\prd.md
</prd_content>

Here is the tech stack information:
<tech_stack_content>
@.ai\doc\tech-stack.md
</tech_stack_content>

Here is the current CLAUDE.md file that needs improvement:
<claude_md_content>
@CLAUDE.md
</claude_md_content>

Your task is to improve the CLAUDE.md file by applying best practices for prompt engineering and regular expressions. Use the information from the PRD and tech stack files to ensure the improvements are aligned with the project requirements and technical constraints.

When improving the CLAUDE.md file, follow these best practices:

**For Regular Expressions:**

- Use clear, readable patterns with proper escaping
- Include comments explaining complex regex patterns
- Use named capture groups where appropriate
- Optimize for performance and maintainability
- Include examples of matching and non-matching strings
- Consider edge cases and validation scenarios

**For Prompt Engineering:**

- Write clear, specific instructions
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Include relevant examples and context
- Define expected input and output formats
- Specify error handling and edge cases
- Use appropriate XML tags for structure
- Make instructions actionable and unambiguous

**Integration Guidelines:**

- Ensure compatibility with the specified tech stack
- Align improvements with PRD requirements and goals
- Consider the target audience and use cases
- Maintain consistency with project conventions
- Include proper documentation and comments

Before providing your improved version, use the scratchpad to analyze the current file and plan your improvements.

<scratchpad>
[Analyze the current CLAUDE.md file, identify areas for improvement, plan how to incorporate PRD and tech stack information, and outline the specific changes you will make]
</scratchpad>

Provide your improved CLAUDE.md file content inside <improved_claude_md> tags. Ensure that all improvements are well-documented and follow the best practices outlined above.
